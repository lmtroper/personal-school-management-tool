## Course Organizer/Tracker Tool

The program was designed as a personal-management tool to improve organizational skills and time management. The tool receives information about upcoming course deliverables and assessments (course, deadline, weight, etc.), and personal goals/expectations for each assessment (anticipated mark and hours to study).
